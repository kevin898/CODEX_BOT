# H4 Zone Retest EA (MQL5)

An automated trading Expert Advisor (EA) for MetaTrader 5, developed in MQL5.  
The EA trades gold (XAUUSD) using a multi-timeframe breakout and retest strategy: it defines the first H4 candle of each day as a trading zone, detects breakouts on the M5 chart, waits for a retest, and executes trades with risk management, trailing stops, and optional news filtering.

---

## Features

- H4 → M5 breakout and retest trading logic  
- Configurable fixed lot or risk-based position sizing  
- Trailing stop management  
- **Smart news filter** that avoids trading around high-impact events  
- Spread and terminal safety checks  
- Dynamic lot calculation based on risk percentage  

## Strategy Overview

1. **Zone identification (H4)**  
   The EA marks the first H4 candle of the current day and stores its high and low as the trading zone boundaries.

2. **Breakout detection (M5)**  
   On each new M5 candle:  
   - A bullish breakout occurs when the candle closes above `zoneHigh`.  
   - A bearish breakout occurs when the candle closes below `zoneLow`.  
   When a breakout occurs, the EA starts waiting for a retest.

3. **Retest entry**  
   - If price returns to the broken zone within a specified window (`MaxWaitSeconds`):  
     - **Buy** on bullish retest → SL = breakout candle low, TP = 1.5 × risk distance.  
     - **Sell** on bearish retest → SL = breakout candle high, TP = 1.5 × risk distance.  
   - Uses either a fixed lot (`Lots`) or a risk-based lot (`UseRiskPercent`, `RiskPercent`).

4. **Trade management and protection**  
   - Trailing stop control (`UseTrailingStop`, `TrailingStart`, `TrailingStep`).  
   - Spread and trade-permission checks (`MaxSpreadPoints`, `TERMINAL_TRADE_ALLOWED`).  
   - **Built-in news filter**: the EA checks the MetaTrader 5 economic calendar (`CalendarValueHistory`) and automatically avoids opening new trades within the defined window around **high-impact news events** for a selected currency (`NewsFilterCurrency`, `NewsFilterMinutes`).  
   - This filter helps prevent entries during volatile periods and improves stability during major market announcements.
